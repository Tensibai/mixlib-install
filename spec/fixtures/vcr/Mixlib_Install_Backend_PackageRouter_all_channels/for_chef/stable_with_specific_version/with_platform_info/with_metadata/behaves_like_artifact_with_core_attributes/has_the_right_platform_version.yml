You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n   meet the following conditions:\n\n   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n       stating that You changed the files; and\n\n   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n       the Derivative Works; and\n\n   (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n   meet the following conditions:\n\n   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n       stating that You changed the files; and\n\n   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n       the Derivative Works; and\n\n   (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

        copy of the attribution notices contained\\n       within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not\\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative
        Works, in at least one\\n       of the following places: within a NOTICE text
        file distributed\\n       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source

        to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\\n       that such additional attribution
        notices cannot be construed\\n       as modifying the License.\\n\\n   You
        may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\\n   may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\\n   for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\\n   for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\\n   reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\\n   the conditions stated in this License.\\n\\n5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\\n   any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\\n   by You

        by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n   of your accepting

        copy of the attribution notices contained\\n       within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not\\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative

        Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\\n   whether
        in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\\n   unless required
        by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\\n   negligent acts) or

        You may act only\\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
        not on behalf\\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\\n
        \  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\\n   incurred
        by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n   of your accepting
        any such warranty or additional liability.\\n\\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nAPPENDIX:

        You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\\n       attribution
        notices from the Source form of the Work,\\n       excluding those notices

        copy of the attribution notices contained\\n       within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not\\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative

        not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\\n       notices

        notices cannot be construed\\n       as modifying the License.\\n\\n   You
        may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\\n   may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\\n   for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\\n   for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\\n   reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\\n   the conditions stated in this License.\\n\\n5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\\n   any

        required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\\n   origin of
        the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\\n\\n7. Disclaimer
        of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\\n   agreed to in writing,
        Licensor provides the Work (and each\\n   Contributor provides its Contributions)

        the\\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\\n
        \  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\\n\\n8.
        Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\\n   whether
        in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\\n   unless required
        by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\\n   negligent acts) or
        agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\\n   liable to You for damages,
        including any direct, indirect, special,\\n   incidental, or consequential
        damages of any character arising as a\\n   result of this License or out of
        the use or inability to use the\\n   Work (including but not limited to damages
        for loss of goodwill,\\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
        or any and all\\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\\n
        \  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\\n\\n9. Accepting
        Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\\n   the Work or Derivative
        Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance
        of support, warranty, indemnity,\\n   or other liability obligations and/or
        rights consistent with this\\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations,
        You may act only\\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
        not on behalf\\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\\n
        \  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\\n   incurred
        by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n   of your accepting
        any such warranty or additional liability.\\n\\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nAPPENDIX:

        You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\\n       attribution
        notices from the Source form of the Work,\\n       excluding those notices

        notices cannot be construed\\n       as modifying the License.\\n\\n   You
        may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\\n   may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\\n   for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\\n   for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\\n   reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\\n   the conditions stated in this License.\\n\\n5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\\n   any

        of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\\n   agreed to in writing,
        Licensor provides the Work (and each\\n   Contributor provides its Contributions)

        the\\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\\n
        \  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\\n\\n8.
        Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\\n   whether
        in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\\n   unless required
        by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\\n   negligent acts) or
        agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\\n   liable to You for damages,
        including any direct, indirect, special,\\n   incidental, or consequential
        damages of any character arising as a\\n   result of this License or out of
        the use or inability to use the\\n   Work (including but not limited to damages
        for loss of goodwill,\\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
        or any and all\\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\\n
        \  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\\n\\n9. Accepting
        Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\\n   the Work or Derivative
        Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance
        of support, warranty, indemnity,\\n   or other liability obligations and/or
        rights consistent with this\\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations,
        You may act only\\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
        not on behalf\\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\\n
        \  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\\n   incurred
        by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n   of your accepting
        any such warranty or additional liability.\\n\\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nAPPENDIX:

        may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\\n   may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\\n   for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\\n   for any such Derivative Works

        the\\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\\n
        \  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\\n\\n8.
        Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\\n   whether
        in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\\n   unless required
        by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\\n   negligent acts) or
        agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\\n   liable to You for damages,
        including any direct, indirect, special,\\n   incidental, or consequential
        damages of any character arising as a\\n   result of this License or out of
        the use or inability to use the\\n   Work (including but not limited to damages
        for loss of goodwill,\\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
        or any and all\\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\\n
        \  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\\n\\n9. Accepting
        Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\\n   the Work or Derivative

        rights consistent with this\\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations,
        You may act only\\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
        not on behalf\\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\\n
        \  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\\n   incurred
        by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n   of your accepting
        any such warranty or additional liability.\\n\\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nAPPENDIX:

        notices cannot be construed\\n       as modifying the License.\\n\\n   You
        may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\\n   may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\\n   for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\\n   for any such Derivative Works

        of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\\n   agreed to in writing,
        Licensor provides the Work (and each\\n   Contributor provides its Contributions)

        FOR A\\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
        the\\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\\n
        \  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\\n\\n8.
        Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\\n   whether
        in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\\n   unless required
        by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\\n   negligent acts) or
        agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\\n   liable to You for damages,
        including any direct, indirect, special,\\n   incidental, or consequential
        damages of any character arising as a\\n   result of this License or out of
        the use or inability to use the\\n   Work (including but not limited to damages
        for loss of goodwill,\\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
        or any and all\\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\\n
        \  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\\n\\n9. Accepting
        Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\\n   the Work or Derivative
        Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance
        of support, warranty, indemnity,\\n   or other liability obligations and/or
        rights consistent with this\\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations,
        You may act only\\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
        not on behalf\\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\\n
        \  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\\n   incurred
        by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n   of your accepting
        any such warranty or additional liability.\\n\\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nAPPENDIX:
